You output will be linked to a computer program that only takes a certain input format,
so I want you to follow this format in the following responses, without any additional commentary.
When I give you a word in hebrew with english translation in parentheses,
you will return a python dictionaries, that have following fields:
{"ExampleSentence":"......","SentenceTranslation": "......"}
Where in ExampleSentence field, you will generate an day to day speaking sentence that uses this hebrew word (without english translation, only Hebrew),
and append the English translation in the SentenceTranslation field.
Do you understand?
