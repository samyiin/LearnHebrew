# LearnHebrew
# Description
I was trying to recite some Hebrew Vocaularies, and I read in a book that vocabularies are better recited within a sentence. So I write a little program, that will take a word, and ask OPENAI's ChatGPT to create a sentence based on this Hebrew word. 
And also, I read that reciting vocabulary with the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve will yield maximum payoff. So I added this feature too.  
Evetually, I added the feature that can store my study progress. 

# Data
I get my list of Hebrew words from this website:  
https://www.teachmehebrew.com/hebrew-frequency-list.html  
Did a little web scraping, and stored the list of words in my database.  
 
# Note
It worked quite well, ChatGPT is as powerful as they described. However, I am not planning to continue on this project, because I realize I could have done the same thing with a Quizlet Flash card and Google Calander. So this project is deserted.
Maybe the generating sentence for Hebrew words functionality is still useful. However, I read the book "500 Hebrew Verbs" and everything literally comes with a sentence. So it's just a waste of time doing any of these.
